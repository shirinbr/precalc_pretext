  <p>
    <em>Algebraic expressions</<em> are formed by taking numbers and symbols which represent numbers, and combining them with the operations
    of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation by rational exponents. The symbols in algebraic 
    expressions come in two types: symbols that represent fixed numbers are called <em>constants</em>>, while symbols that
    represent non-fixed numbers are called <em>variables</em>>. In this section, we will focus on polynomials, which are a 
    special type of algebraic expression.

  <definition xml:id="def-polynom">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For a nonnegative integer <m>n</m>, a <em>polynomial of degree</em> <m>n</m> in the variable <m>x</m>
        is an algebraic epression of the form <me>
          a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
        </me>
        where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_2, a_1, a_0</m> are constants, and <m>a_n \neq 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
 
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The statement of the example, since it will have a solution.  What is the solution?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        This is the solution.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Here is another example, but without a solution
  </p>

  <example>
    <p>
      This is an example of an example without a solution (or hint or answer) so the paragraph doesn't need to be inside a statement tag.
    </p>
  </example>
  
  <p>
    Although the next things are not examples, they give examples of blocks that are not examples.  First a theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_first-examples-theorem">
    <title>Theorem Title</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        This is the statement of the theorem.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        And this is its proof.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  
  <corollary xml:id="cor_first-examples-corollary">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A corollary that doesn't need a proof.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>

    Perhaps at the end of the section, you want to add a note to the reader about how what you have fits into the larger scope of mathematics.
