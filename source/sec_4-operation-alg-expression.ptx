  <title>Operations with Algebraic Expressions</title>
  
  <p>
    <em>Algebraic expressions</em> are formed by taking numbers and symbols which represent numbers, and combining them with the operations
    of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation by rational exponents. The symbols in algebraic 
    expressions come in two types: symbols that represent fixed numbers are called <em>constants</em>, while symbols that
    represent non-fixed numbers are called <em>variables</em>. In this section, we will focus on polynomials, which are a 
    special type of algebraic expression.

        For a nonnegative integer <m>n</m>, a <em>polynomial of degree <m>n</m></em>  in the variable <m>x</m>
        is an algebraic epression of the form <me>
